RESTful APIs are a standard for web services, allowing communication between a server and client in a stateless manner. We‚Äôll start by setting up the Express server and defining routes for CRUD operations. Along the way, we‚Äôll use MongoDB for database management and explore best practices like input validation and error handling. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to create a fully functional API that can handle requests and interact with a database, perfect for integrating into modern web and mobile applications."
